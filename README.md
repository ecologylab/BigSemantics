BigSemantics
============

**BigSemantics** is a free and open-source software architecture for developing powerful applications that present interactive semantic information (*metadata*) from diverse information sources. Semantic information provides a summary of the underlying information resource that can be seen by the user without leaving the current context or site.

An example is the [Metadata In-Context Expander](http://ecologylab.net/mice) which helps the user maintain context while exploring linked semantic information. The MICE homepage shows semantic information for a CD on Amazon. Linked information, such as related bestseller lists or items people also buy, can be expanded in the same context. Some more examples:

* [A movie on IMDb](http://ecologylab.net/research/bigsemantics/MICE/index.html?url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1707386)
* [A scholarly paper from the ACM Digital Library](http://ecologylab.net/research/bigsemantics/MICE/index.html?url=http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1121979)
* [A Wikipedia article](http://ecologylab.net/research/bigsemantics/MICE/index.html?url=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pablo_Picasso)
